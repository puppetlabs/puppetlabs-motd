## Module Description

The motd module configures a system message of the day. The module includes a default message template. Alternatively, you can specify a different template or a static string.

## Setup

### Beginning with the motd module

To configure motd on your system, include the `motd` class: `include motd`.

## Usage

The motd module configures the message of the day on a wide variety of systems. The module populates either `/etc/motd`, `/etc/issue` and `/etc/issue.net` (on POSIX systems) or a registry key (on Windows systems) with the contents of a basic template file.

By default, the module populates motd using the included template. Alternatively, you can specify a different template or a static string. For example, to use a custom template you would set the template parameter:

```puppet
class { 'motd':
  template => 'mymodule/mytemplate.epp',
}
```

To specify a string as the message of the day:

```puppet
class { 'motd':
  content => "Hello world!\n",
}
```

## Reference

See [REFERENCE.md](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-motd/blob/master/REFERENCE.md)

## Limitations

For an extensive list of supported operating systems, see [metadata.json](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-motd/blob/master/metadata.json)

Disabling dynamic motd is supported only on Debian.

### A note on Windows

On Windows systems, the motd module populates the contents of `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\policies\system\legalnoticetext` and `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\policies\system\legalnoticecaption`. The `legalnoticetext` registry key is shown before login on a Windows system.

## Development

We are experimenting with a new tool for running acceptance tests. It's name is [puppet_litmus](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet_litmus) this replaces beaker as the test runner. To run the acceptance tests follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet_litmus/wiki/Tutorial:-use-Litmus-to-execute-acceptance-tests-with-a-sample-module-(MoTD)#install-the-necessary-gems-for-the-module).

Puppet Labs modules on the Puppet Forge are open projects, and community contributions are essential for keeping them great. We can’t access the huge number of platforms and myriad hardware, software, and deployment configurations that Puppet is intended to serve. We want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes so that our modules work in your environment. There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things. For more information, see our [module contribution guide.](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/contributing.html)
